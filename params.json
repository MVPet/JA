{"name":"Jump Arena","tagline":"A Battle Arena Fighitng Game Experiment","body":"### Welcome to Jump Arena\r\n\r\nJump Arena is a Battle-Arena Fighting Game in the vein of Super Smash Bros and Jump Stars Series. The project came about while playing Jump Ultimate Stars. I was curious as to how J.U.S. would play if the mechanics were more like a standard fighting game. An example would be, instead of having certain levels of characters have different movesets, make one standardized moveset for that character.\r\n\r\nI also wanted to make this as the Battle Arena Fighting Game is my favorite style of gameplay.\r\n\r\nDevelopment recently began and is not yet in a playable state.\r\n\r\n### Updates:\r\n```\r\n August 19, 2014\r\n- Framework for Fights and Stages implemented\r\n- Framework for Characters half implemented\r\n- Began code for new character\r\n- Added new Stage: Training\r\n- Animations implemented\r\n```\r\n\r\n[Back to Main Page](http://mvpet.github.io/)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
