<a name="welcome-to-jump-arena" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-jump-arena"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Welcome to Jump Arena</h3>

<p>Jump Arena is a Battle-Arena Fighting Game in the vein of Super Smash Bros and Jump Stars Series. The project came about while playing Jump Ultimate Stars. I was curious as to how J.U.S. would play if the mechanics were more like a standard fighting game. An example would be, instead of having certain levels of characters have different movesets, make one standardized moveset for that character.</p>

<p>I also wanted to make this as the Battle Arena Fighting Game is my favorite style of gameplay.</p>

<p>Development recently began and is not yet in a playable state.</p>
